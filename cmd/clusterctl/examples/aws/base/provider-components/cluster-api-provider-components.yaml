                uses different field names and formatting). 2) It removes some of

                        defaults for the user. These defaults may differ based on
                        the cluster installer, but the tool should populate the values
                        it uses when persisting Machine objects. A Machine spec missing
                        this field at runtime is invalid.

                will be populated with a succinct value suitable for machine interpretation,
                while ErrorMessage will contain a more verbose string suitable for
                logging and human consumption.  These fields should not be set for
                transitive errors that a controller faces that are expected to be
                fixed automatically over time (like service outages), but instead
                indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the MachineTemplate's
                spec or the configuration of the machine controller, and that manual
                intervention is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid
                combinations of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported
                by the machine controller, or the responsible machine controller itself
                being critically misconfigured.  Any transient errors that occur during
                the reconciliation of Machines can be added as events to the MachineSet
                object and/or logged in the controller's output.
