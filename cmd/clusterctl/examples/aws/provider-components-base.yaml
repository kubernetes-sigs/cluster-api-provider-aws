                it to    the Node, and finding the appropriate field in Node.Status.NodeInfo    (which
                uses different field names and formatting). 2) It removes some of
                the dependency on the structure of the Node,    so that if the structure
                of Node.Status.NodeInfo changes, only    machine controllers need
                to be updated, rather than every client    of the Machines API. 3)
                There is no other simple way to check the control plane    version.
                A client would have to connect directly to the apiserver    running
