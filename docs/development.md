## Setting up

### Base requirements

1. Install [go][go]
   - Get the latest patch version for go v1.11.
2. Install [jq][jq]
   - `brew install jq` on MacOS.
3. Install [gettext][gettext] package
   - `brew install gettext && brew link --force gettext` on MacOS.
4. Install [KIND][kind]
   - `go get sigs.k8s.io/kind`.
5. Install [bazel][bazel]
6. Configure Python 2.7+ with [pyenv][pyenv] if your default is Python 3.x.

[go]: https://golang.org/doc/install

### Get the source

`go get -d sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-provider-aws`

Ensure you have updated the vendor directory with:

``` shell
cd "$(go env GOPATH)/src/sigs.k8s.io/cluster-api-provider-aws"
make dep-ensure
```

### Get familiar with basic concepts

This provider is modeled after the upstream cluster-api project. To get familiar
with resources, concepts and conventions refer to the [upstream gitbook](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/cluster-api/).

### Dev manifest files

Part of running cluster-api-provider-aws is generating manifests to run.
Generating dev manifests allows you to test dev images instead of the default
releases.

### Dev images

#### Container registry

Instructions for setting up a Google Container Registry (GCR) are below, but
GCR is not required. The requirement is any public container registry.

AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) isn't recommended as public images are required
for the provider manifests.

##### Setting up a Google Container Registry

This project provides a [Terraform module](../hack/terraform-gcr-init/README.md)
that creates a new Google Cloud project suitable for use by Cluster API.

## Developing

Change some code!

### Manual Testing

#### Setting up the environment

Your environment must have your the AWS credentials as outlined in the [getting
started prerequisites section](./getting-started.md#Prerequisites)

#### Dev manifests

The dev version of the manifests can be generated with

`make manifests-dev examples-dev`

#### Building and pushing dev images to GCR

1. [Install the gcloud cli][gcloud_sdk].
2. Set project: `gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_NAME`.
3. Build & push dev images: `make docker-push-dev`.

#### Running clusterctl

`make create-cluster` will launch a bootstrap cluster and then run the generated
manifests creating a target cluster in AWS. After this is finished you will have
a kubeconfig copied locally. You can debug most issues by SSHing into the
instances that have been created and reading `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`.

### Automated Testing

#### Mocks

Mocks are set up using Bazel, see [build](../../build)

If you then want to use these mocks with `go test ./...`, run

`make copy-genmocks`
