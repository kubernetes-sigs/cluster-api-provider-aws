# Release Process Guide

**Important:** Before you start, make sure all [periodic tests](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-cluster-lifecycle-cluster-api-provider-aws) are passing on the most recent commit that will be included in the release. Check for consistency by scrolling to the right to view older test runs.
    Examples:
    - <https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-cluster-lifecycle-cluster-api-provider-aws-1.5#periodic-e2e-release-1-5>
    - <https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-cluster-lifecycle-cluster-api-provider-aws-1.5#periodic-eks-e2e-release-1-5>

## Create tag, and build staging container images

1. Create a new local repository of <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws> (e.g. using `git clone`).
1. If this is a major or minor release, create a new release branch and push to GitHub, otherwise switch to it, e.g. `git checkout release-1.5`.
1. If this is a major or minor release, update `metadata.yaml` by adding a new section with the version, and make a commit.
1. Update the release branch on the repository, e.g. `git push origin HEAD:release-1.5`.
1. Make sure your repo is clean by git standards.
1. Set environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` to a GitHub personal access token. The token must have write access to the `kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-aws` repository.
1. Set environment variables `PREVIOUS_VERSION` which is the last release tag and `VERSION` which is the current release version, e.g. `export PREVIOUS_VERSION=v1.4.0 VERSION=v1.5.0`, or `export PREVIOUS_VERSION=v1.5.0 VERSION=v1.5.1`).
    _**Note**_: the version MUST contain a `v` in front.
1. Create a tag `git tag -s -m $VERSION $VERSION`. `-s` flag is for GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) signing.
1. Make sure you have push permissions to the upstream CAPA repo. Push tag you've just created (`git push <upstream-repo-remote> $VERSION`).
1. A prow job will start running to push images to the staging repo, can be seen [here](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-cluster-lifecycle-image-pushes#post-cluster-api-provider-aws-push-images). The job is called "post-cluster-api-provider-aws-push-images," and is defined in <https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/master/config/jobs/image-pushing/k8s-staging-cluster-api.yaml>.
1. When the job is finished, wait for the images to be created: `docker pull gcr.io/k8s-staging-cluster-api-aws/cluster-api-aws-controller:$VERSION`. You can also wrap this with a command to retry periodically, until the job is complete, e.g. `watch --interval 30 --chgexit docker pull <...>`.

## Promote container images from staging to production

Promote the container images from the staging registry to the production registry (`registry.k8s.io/cluster-api-provider-aws`) by following the steps below.

1. Navigate to the staging repository [dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/k8s-staging-cluster-api-aws/GLOBAL).
2. Choose the _top level_ [cluster-api-aws-controller](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/k8s-staging-cluster-api-aws/GLOBAL/cluster-api-aws-controller?gcrImageListsize=30) image. Only the top level image provides the multi-arch manifest, rather than one for a specific architecture.
3. Wait for an image to appear with the tagged release version.
4. Click on the `Copy full image name` icon
5. Ensure you have a fork of <https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io>
6. Create a new branch in your fork
7. Edit `registry.k8s.io/images/k8s-staging-cluster-api-aws/images.yaml` and add an entry for the version using the pasted value from earlier. For example: `"sha256:863ec7ea01f887b1af3c34e420d595e75da76d536326ac2f5e87010c0e1d49d3": ["v2.2.2"]`
8. You can use [this PR](https://github.com/kubernetes/k8s.io/pull/5849) as example
9. Wait for the PR to be approved (typically by CAPA maintainers authorized to merge PRs into the k8s.io repository) and merged.
10. Verify the images are available in the production registry:

```bash
docker pull registry.k8s.io/cluster-api-aws/cluster-api-aws-controller:${VERSION}
```

## Create release artifacts, and a GitHub draft release

1. Again, make sure your repo is clean by git standards.
1. Export the current branch `export BRANCH=release-1.5` (`export BRANCH=main`)and run `make release`.
1. Run `make create-gh-release` to create a draft release on Github, copying the generated release notes from `out/CHANGELOG.md` into the draft.
1. Run `make upload-gh-artifacts` to upload artifacts from .out/ directory. You may run into API limit errors, so verify artifacts at next step.
1. Verify that all the files below are attached to the drafted release:
    1. `clusterawsadm-darwin-amd64`
    1. `clusterawsadm-linux-amd64`
    1. `infrastructure-components.yaml`
    1. `cluster-template.yaml`
    1. `cluster-template-machinepool.yaml`
    1. `cluster-template-eks.yaml`
    1. `cluster-template-eks-managedmachinepool.yaml`
    1. `cluster-template-eks-managedmachinepool-vpccni.yaml`
    1. `cluster-template-eks-managedmachinepool-gpu.yaml`
    1. `eks-controlplane-components.yaml`
    1. `eks-bootstrap-components.yaml`
    1. `metadata.yaml`
1. Finalise the release notes by editing the draft release.
    _**Note**_: ONLY do this _after_ you verified that the promotion succeeded [here](https://testgrid.k8s.io/sig-k8s-infra-k8sio#post-k8sio-image-promo).

## Publish the draft release

1. Publish release. Use the pre-release option for release candidate versions of Cluster API Provider AWS.
