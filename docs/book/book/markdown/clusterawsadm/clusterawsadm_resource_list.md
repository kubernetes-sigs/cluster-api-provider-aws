## clusterawsadm resource list

List all AWS resources created by CAPA

### Synopsis

List AWS resources directly created by CAPA based on region and cluster-name. There are some indirect resources like Cloudwatch alarms, rules, etc which are not directly created by CAPA, so those resources are not listed here. If region and cluster-name are not set, then it will throw an error.

```
