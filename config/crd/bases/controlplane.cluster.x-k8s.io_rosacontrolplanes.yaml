                                PrefixPolicy specifies how a prefix should apply.


                                By default, claims other than `email` will be prefixed with the issuer URL to
                                prevent naming clashes with other plugins.


                                Set to "NoPrefix" to disable prefixing.


                                Example:
                                    (1) `prefix` is set to "myoidc:" and `claim` is set to "username".
                                        If the JWT claim `username` contains value `userA`, the resulting
                                        mapped value will be "myoidc:userA".
                                    (2) `prefix` is set to "myoidc:" and `claim` is set to "email". If the
                                        JWT `email` claim contains value "userA@myoidc.tld", the resulting
                                        mapped value will be "myoidc:userA@myoidc.tld".
                                    (3) `prefix` is unset, `issuerURL` is set to `https://myoidc.tld`,
                                        the JWT claims include "username":"userA" and "email":"userA@myoidc.tld",
                                        and `claim` is set to:
                                        (a) "username": the mapped value will be "https://myoidc.tld#userA"
