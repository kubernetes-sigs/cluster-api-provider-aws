                                    ID defines a unique identifier to reference this resource.
                                    If you're bringing your subnet, set the AWS subnet-id here, it must start with `subnet-`.


                                    When the VPC is managed by CAPA, and you'd like the provider to create a subnet for you,
                                    the id can be set to any placeholder value that does not start with `subnet-`;
                                    upon creation, the subnet AWS identifier will be populated in the `ResourceID` field and
                                    the `id` field is going to be used as the subnet name. If you specify a tag
                                    called `Name`, it takes precedence.

                                  By default, when creating a VPC, AWS creates a security group called `default` with ingress and egress
