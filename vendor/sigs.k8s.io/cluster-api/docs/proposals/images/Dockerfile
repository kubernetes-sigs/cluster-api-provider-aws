# - Mount the current working directory into the container.
# - Run the entrypoint as the user invoking docker run. Otherwise the output
#   files will be owned by root, the default user.

# - Example:
# docker run \
# 	--rm \
# 	--volume ${PWD}:/figures \
# 	--user $(shell id --user):$(shell id --group) \
# 	${IMAGE_TAG} \
# 	-v /figures/*.plantuml

# By default, java writes a 'hsperfdata_<username>' directory in the work dir.
# This directory is not needed; to ensure it is not written, we set `-XX:-UsePerfData`
