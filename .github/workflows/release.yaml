# As opposed to https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api (CAPI), the CAPA upstream project does not offer
# a GitHub action to automatically create releases from tags (as of 2023-08-21). Therefore, this is a Giant Swarm
# fork-specific addition. We require a GitHub release containing the YAML manifests which we use in
# cluster-api-provider-aws-app. Since doing this manually is very error-prone (see
# `docs/book/src/development/releasing.md`), we run the needed commands here.
